It will require you to clear your cache, however.  New cards: The Eyrie, Retaliation, Crow Killers, The Frozen Shore, Dalla.  Various fixes.  Implemented text based indicators for card counters."

        "text": "Have introduced an option to specify what type of game you're looking for.  This is meant only as an indicator and does nothing more than put a banner in the game title.  New cards: Maester Aemon (WotW), Esgred, Iron Islands Market, Castle Black Mason. Added new action windows after plots are revealed and after cards stand in the standing phase."
